	-NPM comes default with node
	-NPM is responsible for node popularity
	-NPM actually not a framework but platform
	-Built on chrome v8 engine
	-Act as server for program running written in js
	-dependency is handled through package.json file
	-npm init to create package.json
	-npm is used to manage dependency
	-npm install, npm install <package-name>, instally globally (using -g) and locally
	-apps can be built using node or its framework such as xpress.js
	-but we mostly use it for running bower and grunt
	-npm list
	-nested tree
	-npm for build tool
	-diff between ~ and ^
	-diff between dep and devDep
	
Bower
	-manage front end dependencies
	-dependency is handled through bower.json file
	-installed using node (installed globally)
	-bower init to create bower.json
	-bower list
	-flat tree

Grunt
	-task runner
	-grunt-cli globally, grunt per project
	-npm is used for grunt modules
	-multiple tasks --> each task has multiple targets
	-src: ['src/aa.js', 'src/aaa.js']
	-dest: 'dest/b.js'
	-files: {
        'dest/a.js': ['src/aa.js', 'src/aaa.js'],
        'dest/a1.js': ['src/aa1.js', 'src/aaa1.js'],
      }
    -files: [
        {src: ['src/aa.js', 'src/aaa.js'], dest: 'dest/a.js'},
        {src: ['src/aa1.js', 'src/aaa1.js'], dest: 'dest/a1.js'},
      ]
      
1. diff between dependencies in npm and bower
2. diff between dependencies and dev-dependencies
